# Content Database (SQLite)

> Game **content** lives in a SQLite database — the source of truth for the backend. Editing the
> database changes the game. Gameplay stays server-authoritative.

## What's in it

The server loads all content from SQLite at startup (`src/server/content.ts`, via parametrized
queries) into in-memory structures the simulation reads. Tables (`src/server/db/schema.ts`):

| Table | Holds |
|---|---|
| `areas`, `portals` | The world's zones, sizes, spawns, caps, and the portals between them |
| `area_theme` | Each area's **environment look** — ground, props, mood tint, particles, weather, lighting |
| `abilities` | Spells / abilities (damage, range, cooldown, mana, kind, projectile stats) |
| `items` | Equipment (slot/power/hp), loot materials (sell value), and currency |
| `mob_templates` | Monster stats (hp, level, speed, aggro/attack range, damage) |
| `area_mobs` | Which monsters spawn in which area, and how many |
| `loot_entry` | Per-monster drop tables (always / weighted main / rare / gear) |
| `npcs` | Static NPCs (the town vendor) per area |
| `decor` | Static set-dressing **props** per area (the town's tents, palisade, bonfire, torches…) |
| `sprite_tints` | **Sprite color overrides** — multiply a #rrggbb over any source so one image spawns many (dark/gritty) variations. Targets: `mob:<template_id>`, `npc:<kind>`, `hireling:<type>`, `decor:<kind>` |
| `ability_status_effects` | Per-ability **on-hit effects** — `slow` / `burn` (DoT) / `weaken`, with duration + magnitude (seeded from `ability-effects.ts`) |
| `ability_cast_buffs` | Per-ability **self-buff on cast** — `might` / `haste` / `regen` (player shouts, mob heal-spells) |
| `shrine_buffs` | The **shrine blessing pool** — the timed buffs a charged shrine grants at random, with player-facing labels |
| `game_config` | **Global game-tuning overlay** (TrinityCore-style world settings) — `<section>.<field> → value` rows that override the gameplay knobs in `config.ts` at load (difficulty, drops, economy, density, …). Server plumbing/secrets are deliberately excluded |
| `weather_modifiers` | Per-`WeatherKind` **gameplay** multipliers (`move_scale`, `aggro_scale`) — how a weather state *plays*, not just looks (seeded from `weather-effects.ts`) |
| `elite_modifiers` | The elite ("champion") variant roster — flavor prefix + hp/damage/speed multipliers a normal spawn can roll (seeded from `mobs.ts`) |
| `quests` | Quest definitions (schema seeded with a sample) |

## How it works

1. On first run the server creates `game.db` (path from `GAME_DB`, default `game.db`) and **seeds**
   it from the built-in content (`src/server/db/seed.ts`). On later runs it just loads.
2. `content.ts` reads every table with **parametrized prepared statements** and exposes a typed
   `Content` API (`area`, `ability`, `item`, `mobTemplate`, `areaMobs`, `npcs`, `quests`,
   `rollLoot`, …). The simulation (`world.ts`, `instance-manager.ts`) reads only from `Content`.
3. Tests and the default use an in-memory DB (`:memory:`) seeded the same way — zero config.

## Editing the game with SQL

Stop the server, open the database, run SQL, restart:

```bash
sqlite3 game.db
```

```sql
-- Buff a spell
UPDATE abilities SET damage = 40, cooldown_ms = 700 WHERE id = 'fireball';

-- Make wolves tougher
UPDATE mob_templates SET hp = 90, damage = 12 WHERE id = 'wolf';

-- Add a brand-new monster and spawn it in the crypt
INSERT INTO mob_templates
  (id,name,hp,level,hue,speed,aggro_range,attack_range,damage,attack_cooldown_ms)
  VALUES ('dragon','Ancient Dragon',2000,30,10,90,600,80,40,1400);
INSERT INTO area_mobs (area_id, template_id, count) VALUES ('crypt','dragon',1);

-- Change a vendor price, move an NPC, add a quest…
UPDATE items SET sell_value = 400 WHERE id = 'rune_shard';
UPDATE npcs SET x = 800, y = 600 WHERE name = 'Merchant';

-- Re-skin an area's environment (see area_theme below)
UPDATE area_theme SET ground_base = '#2a1830', weather = 'snow' WHERE area_id = 'town';

-- Place a set-dressing prop (see decor below): a torch, a tent, a wall segment…
INSERT INTO decor (area_id, kind, x, y) VALUES ('town','torch',900,700);
INSERT INTO decor (area_id, kind, x, y, x2, y2) VALUES ('town','palisade',470,440,1130,440);
```

All of these take effect on the next server start — no code change. (Gameplay numbers are
server-authoritative, so they apply immediately to combat/loot/spawns.)

## Environment themes — the *look* is data too (`area_theme`)

Each area has one `area_theme` row driving its entire appearance — the client renders ground
colors, scattered props, mood tint, ambient particles, weather (rain/snow/fog), and lighting
**entirely from these columns**. Column names match the keys in `src/shared/theme.ts`:

| Column(s) | Effect |
|---|---|
| `ground_base`, `ground_speck` | tiled ground fill + speckle colors |
| `prop`, `prop_density` | scattered props (`tree`/`grave`/`rock`/`bush`/`mushroom`/`crystal`/`pillar`/`none`) and how dense |
| `atmo_color`, `atmo_alpha` | base mood tint over the whole screen |
| `outdoor` | `1` = the day/night cycle applies; `0` = indoor gloom (crypts) |
| `particle_color`, `particle_count`, `particle_rise`, `particle_flicker` | drifting ambient motes |
| `weather`, `weather_intensity`, `fog_color` | weather overlay — **also affects gameplay** (see below) |
| `light_ambient` | baseline light `0..1`; lower = murkier and torch/portal glow reads stronger |
| `grade_saturation`, `grade_brightness`, `grade_contrast` | per-area color grading (one `ColorMatrixFilter`; `1` = unchanged) |
| `sprite_tint` | cohesive tint multiplied onto actor sprites in the area (`#ffffff` = none) |

**Weather is a gameplay input, not just visual** — it's applied server-authoritatively
(`src/server/weather-effects.ts`): `snow` slows player movement, `fog` shrinks monster aggro range,
`rain` does a bit of both. So re-theming an area's weather changes how it *plays*, live.

This is **live-editable without a restart**: the `/settheme <area> <key> <value>` Developer command
(see [Commands & Access](Commands-And-Access.md)) validates + clamps the value, upserts the column,
and re-broadcasts the `content` packet so every connected client re-skins in place. After a direct
`sqlite3` edit, `/reloadcontent` does the same. Values are always validated server-side
(`coerceThemeValue`) — the client never asserts theme state.

## Set-dressing props — the town's *objects* are data too (`decor`)

Static props (the starting town's Diablo-II-style camp: a spiked **palisade** wall, a central
**bonfire**, canvas **tents**, a merchant **wagon**, an **anvil**, **crates**/**barrels**/**hay**,
and **torch** poles) are authoritative SQL rows, **not** client-hardcoded. Each `decor` row is one
prop in world coordinates; the client renders it with the same 2.5D projection, y-sorting, and soft
shadow as actors. Columns:

| Column | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `area_id`, `kind` | which area, and the prop kind (`palisade`/`gate`/`bonfire`/`tent`/`wagon`/`anvil`/`crate`/`barrel`/`hay`/`torch`/`house`/`shrine`/`chest`) |
| `x`, `y` | world position (point props), or the NW corner of the footprint (`house`) |
| `x2`, `y2` | line props (`palisade`/fence): the far endpoint · `house`: the SE corner of the footprint (NULL for point props) |
| `color` | optional cloth/wood tint (CSS hex; NULL = renderer default) |
| `scale` | optional size multiplier (NULL = `1`) |

Props are loaded onto each `AreaDef.decor` and sent in the `content` packet, so adding a row (or
redressing another area) needs no code change — just SQL and a restart (or `/reloadcontent`). Decor
is purely cosmetic (no collision); gameplay stays server-authoritative.

**A few decor kinds drive gameplay, not just visuals.** `shrine` blesses a player who steps within
range with a random timed buff, then recharges (cooldown). `chest` is a placement marker the server
turns into a lootable `chest` entity that pops open on approach, spilling gold + gear. `house`
footprints are solid walls (a shared server/predictor collision module) with a passable south door.
These read their positions from the same `decor` rows, so you place them with SQL like any other prop.

**`house` is special — an enterable building.** Its footprint is the rect from `(x,y)` (NW corner)
to `(x2,y2)` (SE corner), `color` tints the timber, and the door is centered on the south wall. The
renderer draws the floor and walls behind your character but the **roof above** it, then fades that
roof to near-transparent while you stand inside the footprint — so you see your character indoors
(Diablo II / RuneScape style). v1 has no wall collision (you walk in freely); solid walls without
movement rubber-banding need a shared collision module used by both the server and the client
predictor, which is a planned follow-up.

## Client mirrors the database too

On connect the server sends a **`content` packet** (areas, abilities, items) built from the DB.
The client stores it (`src/client/content-store.ts`) and reads everything from it — the hotbar,
portals/minimap, item names/colors, and equip checks. So a brand-new spell added via SQL shows up
in the hotbar, and a new area renders, **with no client code change**. Even the area's *look* now
comes from the DB (`area_theme`, above), so re-skinning is data-driven and live. The client keeps
only pure *presentation* config locally (sprite-sheet frame layouts, physics radii).

The one thing not yet hot-reloaded is **sprite art for a brand-new monster type** added purely via
SQL — it falls back to a procedural shape until a sheet is registered for it. Everything else
(stats, spells, items, areas, spawns, NPCs, vendor prices, loot) is fully data-driven end to end.
